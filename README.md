# Master-Renamer
This is a simple GoogleAppScript that renames all the files in a folder adding also a numerical index if needed.
The basic script has been taken from this blog page: https://www.pbainbridge.co.uk/2019/09/bulk-rename-files-in-google-drive.html

The Google Sheet that uses it at the moment is saved here: G:\My Drive\VOD Project

To work it needs only 3 things really:

- the folder ID
- the string you want to add as a prefix
- to write 'yes' in the cell with the question With Number is you want an automatic numerical index corresponding to the numbers ALREADY present in the file names.
